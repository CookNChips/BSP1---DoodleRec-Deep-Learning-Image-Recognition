# ONGOING/UNFINISHED BSP1 - DoodleRec-Deep-Learning-Image-Recognition
DoodleRec - A Deep Learning algorithm trained on 10 objects from Google Quick Draw's data set, is my first Bachelor Semester Project at the University of Luxembourg.

Current step: program the training algorithm and train it.
#
## How to use this program (so far):

### - If you want to visualize the dataset:

1. Go to https://onedrive.live.com/?id=57F1EE6756D7C71D%2125333&cid=57F1EE6756D7C71D and download the /data folder.
2. Place it aside with the main.py program.
3. In the main.py program, comment/delete the Flask part, and modify the needed parameters. You will then be able to display the 28x28 arrays.



### - If you want to try the early version of the user interface:
1. Run the Flask application from VSCODE or any IDLE.
2. Go to the local port of the application
3. Try to input some doodles, your image data array is updated every 500ms on the website and in the console of the terminal where you run the Flask application.
